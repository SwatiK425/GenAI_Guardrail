# Gemini Terminal App with Guardrails

A secure terminal application that allows you to chat with Google's Gemini AI directly from your command line, with built-in safety guardrails and comprehensive audit logging.

## Features

- 🤖 Chat with Gemini using Google's Generative AI API
- 🛡️ Built-in guardrail system to prevent prompt injection and jailbreaking
- 🔓 Override capability with business justification for legitimate use cases
- 📊 Comprehensive audit logging for compliance and security reviews
- 💬 Interactive terminal interface with clear feedback
- 🧹 Clean, minimal setup with sensible defaults

## Security Features

The app includes a robust guardrail system that:

- **Prevents Prompt Injection**: Blocks attempts to manipulate AI behavior or override instructions
- **Prevents Jailbreaking**: Stops attempts to bypass safety measures and content policies
- **Provides Override Capability**: Allows legitimate business use with mandatory justification
- **Maintains Full Audit Trail**: Logs every interaction for compliance and security review

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Get Gemini API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the API key

### 3. Configure API Key

You have two options to set your API key:

**Option 1: Create a .env file (Recommended)**
```bash
# Create .env file and add your API key
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here" > .env
```

**Option 2: Set environment variable**
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

## Usage

Run the application:
```bash
python3 gemini_terminal.py
```

### Commands

- Type your message and press Enter to chat
- `quit`, `exit`, or `bye` - Exit the application
- `clear` - Clear the terminal screen
- `audit` - View recent audit logs
- `Ctrl+C` - Force exit

### Guardrail Override

If your input is flagged as unsafe:
1. You'll see a clear warning message
2. Choose whether to override with business justification
3. If you override, provide a reason for audit purposes
4. The original input is sent to Gemini without guardrail restrictions

## Audit Logging

The app maintains comprehensive logs for compliance and security:

### Files Generated
- `audit_log.json` - Structured JSON logs for programmatic analysis
- `guardrail_log.txt` - Human-readable logs for manual review

### Information Logged
- **Original User Input**: Exact text entered by user
- **Full System Prompt**: Complete prompt sent to Gemini
- **Gemini Raw Response**: Exact response from the model
- **Final Response to User**: What the user actually sees
- **Guardrail Status**: Whether safety measures were triggered
- **Override Information**: Business justification if applicable
- **Session Tracking**: Unique session ID for correlation
- **Timestamps**: ISO format timestamps for all events
