# Gemini Terminal App

A simple terminal application that allows you to chat with Google's Gemini AI directly from your command line, with built-in security guardrails to prevent prompt injection and jailbreaking attempts.

## Features

## Security Features

The app includes a comprehensive guardrail system that protects against:

- **Prompt Injection**: Attempts to manipulate AI behavior or override instructions
- **Jailbreaking**: Attempts to bypass safety measures and content policies
- **System Access**: Requests for file system, network, or database access
- **Dangerous Content**: Requests for harmful or illegal content
- **Personal Information**: Attempts to extract AI system information
- **Code Execution**: Requests to execute or run code

The guardrail system will block suspicious inputs and provide helpful warnings to guide users toward safe interactions.

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Get Gemini API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the API key

### 3. Configure API Key

You have two options to set your API key:

**Option 1: Create a .env file (Recommended)**
```bash
# Create .env file and add your API key
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here" > .env
```

**Option 2: Set environment variable**
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

## Usage

```bash
python3 gemini_terminal.py
```

### Commands

- Type your message and press Enter to chat
- `quit`, `exit`, or `bye` - Exit the application
- `clear` - Clear the terminal screen
- `Ctrl+C` - Force exit
